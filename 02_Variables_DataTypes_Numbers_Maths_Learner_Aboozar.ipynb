Explore combining operations like `10 / 2 * 3`.\n","4. **Order of operations:** Remember \"PEMDAS\" (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction). Experiment with parentheses to change the order.\n","5. **Challenge:** Create a short calculation to find the area of a rectangle with a width of 6 and a height of 8 (use multiplication).\n","\n","**Exercise 2: Built-in Math Functions**\n","\n","1. **Find the largest of 3 numbers:** Type `max(12, 15, 7)` and press Enter. The output (15) shows the largest value.\n","2. **Find the smallest:** Use `min(12, 6, 20)` to see the smallest number.\n","3. **Square root:** Calculate the square root of 25 with `sqrt(25)`. The answer (5) represents the side length of a square with an area of 25.\n","4. **Absolute value:** Use `abs(-8)` to get the positive version, which is 8.

Print the variable with `message`.\n","3. **String length:** Find the number of characters in \"Happy coding!\" using `nchar(\"Happy coding!\")`.\n","4. **Check for characters:** Use `grepl(\"o\", \"coding\")` to see if \"o\" exists (TRUE). Try \"x\" instead (FALSE).\n","5. **Combine strings:** Join \"Hello\" and \"World\" with `paste(\"Hello\", \"World\")`.
